## 发行说明
[**发行日期: 2022年2月28日**]

### Overview
IvorySQL 1.2 is based on PostgreSQL 14.2 and contains a variety of fixes and new feature from IvorySQL 1.1.
For information about new features in major release 1.0, see [IvorySQL 1.0 release notes](ivorysql-v1-0-release-page).  

This release is compatible with IvorySQL 1.1 and does not require a dump/restore for those running IvorySQL 1.1

However, a couple of bug have been fixed in PostgreSQL 14.2 around possible index corruption (See first and the
second change-log entries of PostgreSQL [14.2 change-log](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.2/) ),
If any of those cases apply to you, It is recommended to reindex the affected indexes after updating to IvorySQL 1.2  

For updates and bug fixes in PostgreSQL 14.2 please refer to Official PostgreSQL release
notes of [14.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/14.2/).
